# Description
the script run_analysis.R follows the instructions from the course project. 
I decided to load the data and clean the data before i merge everything together.

# Prerequisits
the following file structure is expected in the working directory

* ./features.txt
* ./activity_labels.txt
* ./test/X_test.txt
* ./test/y_test.txt
* ./test/subject_test.txt
* ./train/X_train.txt
* ./train/y_train.txt
* ./train/subject_train.txt
